            <div> In Cascading Style Sheets, 
                CSS grid layout or CSS grid creates complex
                responsive web design grid layouts more easily and 
                consistently across browsers.[6] Historically, 
                there have been other methods for controlling web page
                layout methods, such as tables, floats, and more recently, CSS Flexible Box Layout (flexbox). 
                CSS grid is currently not an official standard (it is a W3C Candidate Recommendation)
                although it has been adopted by the recent versions of all current major browsers.[7] </div>
